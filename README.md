# IBM project: AI Legal Sentiment Analyzer

This project automates the sentiment analysis of legal documents, classifying text segments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. It is designed to help legal professionals quickly assess the tone and implications within large volumes of legal text, thereby significantly reducing manual review time and enhancing operational efficiency.

The solution leverages IBM watsonx.ai, specifically its Prompt Lab for prompt engineering and powerful Foundation Models like Google FLAN-T5-XL (and Mistral Large for experimentation). Developed in Python within a Google Colaboratory environment, it utilizes libraries such as Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

It delivers labeled datasets with sentiment tags for each phrase, comprehensive summarized insights including counts and percentages of each sentiment category, and clear visualizations (bar and pie charts) of the overall sentiment distribution. These outputs provide immediate, data-driven understanding of the underlying sentiment in legal documentation.
